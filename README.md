- Step 1:

  The server side is listening on port 3000.

In the terminal, type: npm run server or node server.js.

- Step 2:

  Open a new browser tab and type: http://localhost:3000/message. It will show you a JSON string containing data from my portfolio. If you want to send me some messages, you can do so here.

- Step 3:

  Go to the folder named backendSide and find a file named index.html. Open it in your browser or with Live Server in your VSCode. It will display the messages that people have sent me from my portfolio. There are two buttons, one to show messages and one to delete messages.
